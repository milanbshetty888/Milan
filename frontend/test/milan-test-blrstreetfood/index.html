		<p>Bangalore – An Epicure’s Paradise. Take a walk during the night through the streets of Bangalore and the pleasant aroma of the gourmet food that is prepared here every moment, is sure to leave you in awe. The lovely food prepared in the streets of Bangalore is no less tasty than the local and international cuisines at five-star restaurants. The shops here do not have good seating arrangements- agreed, but eating here in the crescent moonlight with a cool breeze for company is an experience like no other.</p>
		<p>
			Serving utterly delicious Butter Masala Dosa continuously to a huge number of customers is no child’s play. But CTR at Margosa Road, Malleshwaram has done this effortlessly and brilliantly for over six decades and is thus, a delight for Dosa lovers. Even to this day, this Tiffin Room is one of the best places to have South Indian Street Food in Bangalore. Apart from variety of dosas they also serve idly – vada, kesribath and the poori sagu. There are also other shops which serve ice creams, chats and other stuff around the place.
